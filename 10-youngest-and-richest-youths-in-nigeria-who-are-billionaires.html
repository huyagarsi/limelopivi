It is blessed with both human and natural resources. Above all, it is a country with some of the fastest-growing billionaires in the world. The youngest and richest youths in Nigeria have not only achieved financial success but have also made significant contributions to the economic growth of the country cutting across businesses, entertainment and the technological sector.</p><p>Despite raging challenges such as economic instability and political turmoil, these young billionaires have managed to create thriving businesses and solidify their positions as leaders in Africa’s business community. While the likes of Obiozor of Kobo360 and the Dozie brothers make our list of the top 20 young billionaires in Nigeria, here are details of the top ten of Nigeria’s youngest and richest billionaires.</p><h2><strong>Igho Sanomi Is the Richest Youth in Nigeria</strong></h2><p><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $ 1 billion (about ₦460,340,000,000)<br><strong>Age:</strong> 53 Years Old<br><strong>Sources of Income:</strong> Oil, power, logistics, telecommunications, Marine, aviation, real estate<br><strong>Company:</strong> Taleveras&nbsp;Group</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Igho-Sanomi.jpg alt width=696 height=471 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Igho Charles Sanomi is a geologist and public speaker with strong business interest in oil, power, logistics, telecommunications, aviation, real estate, and the maritime industry. Son of a retired Assistant Inspector General of Police, Sanomi was born and raised in Agbor, Delta State, on 17 May 1975 and he is the fifth child of his parent.</p><p>He is the founder of Taleveras, a $2 billion-worth international commodities trading company based in Nigeria (Abuja) and Dubai with additional offices spread across West Africa, Europe and Asia. He became fascinated with the oil industry while in his final year at the University of Jos, Plateau state.</p><p>He handled a couple of structured deals for local oil companies after which he went into a long-term venture with Masefield. After having practical knowledge about oil business, Sanomi was ready to establish his own company and handle oil-related contracts himself. With the little saving he had, alongside his savings from the profit share he had earned from joint venture transactions, Sanomi put together a small team and opened his first business called Sarian Oil.</p><p>With Sarian oil, Sanomi built his business on the back of third-party contracts a few years later, his company became the preferred supplier of fuel oil feedstock to major USA refiners. At the age of 28, he merged various segments of his trading business and renamed the company Taleveras. In its prime, Sanomi’s oil trading company transported over 170 million barrels of crude and oil products annually. Today, it is considered one of the largest independent energy traders in Africa.</p><p>Sanomi has traditionally stayed away from the media spotlight but amid his silence, he has received numerous awards both locally in internationally. He was even cited by Forbes as one of the “Ten Young African Millionaires To Watch in 2013. He and his siblings are the founders of the Dickens Sanomi Foundation – a non-governmental organization focused on alleviating socio-economic hardship across Nigeria.</p><h2><strong>Ladi Delano&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $900 million (about ₦414,306,000,000.00)</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 53 years old</li><li><strong>Sources of Income:</strong> Real Estate, Mining, Agriculture</li><li><strong>Company:</strong> Moove Africa, Bakrie Delano Africa, Grace Lake Partners</li></ul><p>Ladi Delano is one of the youngest and richest youths in Nigeria. He is an entrepreneur known for owning several business ventures that now contribute to his net worth of $900 million.</p><p>Born and raised in the United Kingdom (UK), Delano was a college dropout who though had learning difficulties, found his path in business and today, he earns the billionaire tag just like other <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Nigerian billionaires</a>. He now holds a Master’s degree from Oxford University and an MPA from the London School of Economics. Ladi is the son of a corporate executive and an MBA lecturer and under the tutelage of his father, he was able to understand business trends and how different products come to the market.</p><p>Delana’s first business was as a career adviser to students. He also got recruiters to advertise their companies to students, and set up m-commerce retail platforms where students could make purchases with their mobile phones. This, however, folded up roughly six months after, leading to loss of thousands of dollars.</p><p>In his early 20s, Delana was already a satisfied businessman. He established Solidarnosc Asia, a Chinese alcoholic beverage company that made Solid XS, a premium brand of vodka brand that was distributed in over 30 cities, pulling in $20 million in annual revenue. He later sold the company to a rival liquor business for over $15 million.</p><p>Having tried two businesses that later failed, Delana relocated to Nigeria in 2012 with the hope of digging deep into the country’s potentials. With the knowledge he gained about the country’s growing economy, he pulled together a consortium of high-net-worth families and some financial institutions in the private equity space to invest in Nigeria.</p><p>To achieve his aim, he partnered with Bakrie Group which is one of the largest conglomerates in Indonesia. The joint venture invested in mining, agriculture, and oil and gas industries in Nigeria. Delana is currently the Co-CEO & Co-Founder of Moove and Founder & CEO & Managing Partner at Grace Lake Partners. In 2012, he was Nigeria’s youngest billionaire and was also named one of Forbes’ youngest millionaires to watch in Africa.</p><h2><strong>Obi Cubana&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Net Worth:</strong> $500 million</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 53 years old</li><li><strong>Sources of Income:</strong> Hospitality, Real Estate</li><li><strong>Company:</strong> Cubana Group</li></ul>53 year-old <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Obinna Iyiegbu</a>, popularly known as Obi Cubana makes it to our list of richest youths in Nigeria with a jaw-dropping net worth that he primarily accumulated from his company, Cubana group, which now prides itself as one of Africa’s best hospitality brands.<p>Nicknamed the King of nightlife, Obi Cubana is a business mogul who has maintained his stance of hard work, consistency, and people network as the standard for success. The political science degree holder from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, made his first N1 million from furnishing a house for a client who dashed him N500,000 for a job well done. The money summed up to over a million naira after adding his profit of N600,000.</p><p>His financial stance continued to grow as he received more house contracts. His contract with PPMG and other brands led to his establishment of Ibiza Club in 2006. Located in Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital, Ibiza Club recorded great sales; by 2009, profits generated from the nightclub laid the foundation of the Cubana hospitality services which is now located in Owerri, Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and other states in Nigeria.</p><p>Obi Cubana’s interest in the hospitality industry has undoubtedly enriched his pocket.

According to reports, the Rolls-Royce which was worth around N300 million was given as an act of appreciation for being with him and to appease her for all the hurt he caused her by marrying a second wife.
